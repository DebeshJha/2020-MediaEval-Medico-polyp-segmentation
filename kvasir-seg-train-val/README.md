The VV is the collaboration of the four hospitals that provide healthcare service to 470,000 peoples. The resolution of images varies from 332✕487 to 1920✕1072 pixels. Some of the images contain green thumbnail in the lower-left corner of the images showing the position marking from the ScopeGuide (Olympus).
