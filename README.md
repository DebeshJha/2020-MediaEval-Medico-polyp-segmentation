# Medico-automatic-polyp-segmentation-challenge
The “Medico automatic polyp segmentation task” aims to develop computer-aided diagnosis systems for automatic polyp segmentation to detect all types of polyps (for example, irregular polyp, smaller or flat polyps) with high efficiency and accuracy. The main goal of the challenge is to benchmark semantic segmentation algorithms on a publicly available dataset, emphasizing robustness, speed, and generalization.

Participants will get access to a dataset consisting of 1,000 segmented polyp images from the gastrointestinal tract and a separate testing dataset. The challenge consists of two mandatory tasks, each focused on a different requirement for efficient polyp detection. We hope that this task encourages multimedia researchers to apply their vast knowledge to the medical field and make an impact that may affect real lives.
